Part c:

(1)
Average node degree:1.385

degree is the indicator of connectivity of a node with others. The larger the average node degree is, the more connected the graph is.

(2)
Diameter of the graph:7

Diameter is the spread of nodes in the graph. We can travel between any pair of nodes within that number of steps and the diameter is the upper bound.  

(3)
Average path length:3.742
This is another parameter to indicate how packed the graph is. Average path length is the average distance we will travel between any pair of nodes in the graph.
