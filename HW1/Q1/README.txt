The platform on which I test my code is Mac OS. My python version is 2.7.6 and I haven’t try the code in python 3+ version. Therefore, some minor differences would be possible if you have the python 3+ version in your PC.

After you launch the terminal, enter “python FILENAME” where FILENAME would be “movie_ID_name.py” or “movie_ID_sim_movie_ID.py” in our case. This will create the corresponding txt files, which are included in the folder as my result. To try the code, you can first delete the original txt files and run the code again to see if they work. The resulting files should be the same as the original ones.
